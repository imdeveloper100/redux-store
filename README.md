# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


This React project, built with Vite and Tailwind CSS, features a Product Dashboard and Shopping Cart with Redux state management. It fetches product data from an API (https://fakestoreapi.in/api/products), allowing users to add and remove items from their cart seamlessly.
